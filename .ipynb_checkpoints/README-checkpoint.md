Crypto investing platform for Crypto Noobs

We aim to create a dashboard of various cryptocurrencies, then time permitting, explore machine learning techniques to supplement algorithmic trading strategies.

1. Obtain a list of coins/tokens to perform this activity on.

2. Using Tweepy API, access public tweets on specified date ranges (30 or 90 days for example) whenever the coins are mentioned. Perform sentiment analysis on these tweets, see which coins are talked about positively, and generate word clouds.

3. A dashboard can be created for Crypto Noobs to then pick which coin they want.

3. Time permitting, an extension to the project could be comparing multiple machine learning algorithms, choosing the strongest model, then automating it. This aids the Crypto Noobs in entry and exit timing, and trade management.
